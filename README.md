Deployment: Docker (optional)
<br>
****
Dataset
<br>
The model is trained on a custom dataset containing images categorized into four classes:

Acne
Eczema
Psoriasis
Rosacea
Note: Ensure that the dataset is organized into subfolders named as the class labels.
<br>
<br>
Model Architecture
<br>
The application uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification. The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on the prepared dataset for accurate predictions.
<br>
<br>
Future Enhancements:
Add more skin disorder classes for wider diagnosis.
Implement a user-friendly dashboard for tracking history.
Integrate additional deep learning models for improved accuracy.
